# Data Mining Course

Instructor: [Carlos Castillo](https://chato.cl/)

These are materials for a twelve-weeks undergraduate course on **Data Mining**, and include two-hour lectures and two-hour practice sessions every week. They were developed for third year students of the bachelor degree on *Mathematical Engineering on Data Science* at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona.

* *"Exciting and really helpful for our future as data scientists"* -- a student from the 2019 edition
* *"A lot of work. However, the theory and practice materials are excellent"* -- a student from the 2019 edition

This course was adapted for online learning in 2020. The main changes are that theory lessons are divided into smaller modules, there is only one midterm exam instead of two, no two-people assignments are requested, and individual practices are a little bit longer but more time is given to complete them.
